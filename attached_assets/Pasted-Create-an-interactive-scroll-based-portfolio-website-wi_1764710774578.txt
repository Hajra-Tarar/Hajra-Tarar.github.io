Create an interactive, scroll-based portfolio website with the following structure and design requirements:
Overall Style
* Modern, minimalistic, and visually appealing UI/UX.
* Smooth scrolling transitions between sections.
* Use soft animations (fade-in, slide-in, parallax, or slight movement on scroll).
* Cohesive color palette, consistent typography, and spacious layout.

Section 1: Hero / Landing Section
* Header text: “Vibe Coding”
* Tagline: A placeholder tagline that represents “a journey of exploration through creating, reflecting, and designing projects with AI.”
* Center the text vertically and horizontally with a bold hero layout.
* Add subtle animated background or gradient for visual depth.

Section 2: My Perspective on AI as a Creative Partner
* Create a two-part article-style layout:
    * Part 1: “6 Weeks Ago” — placeholder text
    * Part 2: “Now” — placeholder text
* Layout should resemble a clean digital article: wide margins, readable typography, subtle section dividers, and smooth fade-in on scroll.
* Each part should appear as the user scrolls downward.

Section 3: My Projects (Interactive Zigzag Path)
* Create a visually appealing zigzag path or timeline down the page.
* Three points along the path.
* Each point should:
    * Be clickable or hoverable.
    * Expand, reveal, or pop up a project preview card (use placeholder text + placeholder image).
    * Include micro-interactions (glow on hover, slight scale-up, etc.)
* Ensure this section feels playful and creative, matching the “Vibe Coding” theme.

Section 4: Reflection Section
* Title: “Reflection on the Reading”
* Add a placeholder area for the reflection text.
* Clean, thoughtful layout—soft background, card-style container, or column layout.

Technical Requirements
* Use responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Include smooth scroll animations.
* Use HTML, CSS (Tailwind optional), and JavaScript/React (if needed).
* Create clear component/section structure for easy editing later.

Goal
Produce a complete, aesthetically polished webpage that matches modern portfolio design standards, supports smooth interactions, and leaves room for me to fill in the text later.
