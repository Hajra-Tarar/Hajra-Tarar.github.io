What I Did
My children’s interactive story, Benny’s Forest Adventure, began as a simple curiosity: What if I tried making a storybook even though I had zero background in children’s media? I’ve always wondered what it would feel like to create something fun, warm, and engaging for kids…something that wasn’t just a story to read, but an experience to participate in.
Storytelling has always fascinated me because of how easily it captures attention, and I was curious about how I could make it more interactive. Part of my inspiration came from shows like Dora the Explorer. Her long pauses and questions always felt awkward and funny, but looking back, they were actually way ahead of their time in how they engaged children even without AI. That made me want to experiment with bringing that same spirit of interaction into a digital environment.
So I created Benny’s Forest Adventure, a story about a bunny named Benny who is trying to make his way home through the forest. Along the way, he meets animal friends who need his help, and the child can only help them by spelling each animal’s name correctly through a missing letter game. So instead of just reading straight through, the story turned into a small interactive learning journey.
To make the experience more immersive, I added simple animal sounds that play after every correct answer, hoping it might help kids associate spelling with sound and imagery. The story ends with Benny reaching his cozy burrow, where all the animals gather to celebrate and sing a joyful song.
Therefore, With this project, my creativity really opened up. I was able to combine storytelling, gameplay, and early learning in a way I never imagined I could create on my own from scratch.
What I Learned
This project was the perfect starting point for me to understand what AI can make possible. It showed me that AI can help bring an idea to life even when you have no experience in a particular creative medium. It allowed me to move from concept to prototype incredibly quickly, which made the process feel exciting and accessible.
But the more I worked, the more I realized that AI can only take a project so far. While it saves time and helps generate early drafts, the quality of the final product still depends on my own creativity, decisions, and willingness to revise. The limitations became very visible when I tried to refine the design, visuals, pacing, or audio. None of those elements became good automatically and I had to provide it with seperate resources and basically shape them intentionally.
So the biggest thing I learned is that AI works best as a creative partner when you avoid treating it as a replacement. It can build you first, second, and many versions but only you can get it to the final one. It certainly helps you accelerate the starting point, and in my opinion, that is its greatest strength.  But because of that speed, it becomes even more important to add your own judgement and creativity on top of what it gives you.
While working on this, I kept thinking back to Kate Crawford’s argument in The Atlas of AI about the belief that humanlike intelligence can be created through nonhuman systems. In my project, it became clear that although AI can mimic creativity, it doesn’t truly understand the intention part right away (not unless you have nailed down the prompt engineering part). However, that part I believe still relied entirely on me. Crawford’s perspective helped me put words to what I was experiencing: AI can imitate patterns of storytelling, but it cannot replace the human_ that give a story purpose. This project would have been incomplete if it wasn't for the time, patience, and the continuous back and forth with Replit to achieve the vision I wanted.
During this project, I kept thinking about Kate Crawford’s argument in The Atlas of AI about the idea that people often believe humanlike intelligence can emerge from nonhuman systems if we simply train them enough. But working on this project made me realise some of the limits of that belief. Yes, AI can create stories and experiences but it never truly understands the intention part right away (not unless you have nailed down the prompt engineering part). That part, I believe, still depends entirely on me. This project also reminded me how important it is to stay actively involved in the creation process with AI, and not just settle for whatever it produces first. Otherwise, our originality and values might get lost. This project would have also been incomplete for me if it wasn't for the time, patience, and the continuous back and forth with Replit that got me to achieve the vision I wanted with AI as a creative partner.
